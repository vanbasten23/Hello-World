/*
 You are to write a program that simulates a cash register. 
 For example, if something cost $10.25 and the customer pays with a $20 bill, the program will print out the most efficient "change-breakdown" which is 1 five, 4 ones, and 3 quarters.

            cout<<"5 cent:"<<cent5<<" ";
        if(cent != 0)
            cout<<"cent:"<<cent<<endl;
        return 0;
	}    
}

REMARK:
1. cost and paid should be float instead of int. Other than that, this problem is nother but tedious.
