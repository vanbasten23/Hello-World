/*
 Glitch is a walking robort moves in a peculiar problem: it takes x steps forward , then x+1 steps backward, then 2x steps forward, x+2 steps backward,3x steps forward x+3 steps backward , and so on... until it has taken y steps,glitch turns 180 degrees before continuning with its pattern . write a program that prompts x and y and total number of steps taken and outputs how many steps away from its starting point
